                    On 3 September 1971, Qatar officially gained its independence from the United Kingdom and became an
                    independent sovereign state. In 1972, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani seized power in a palace coup after
                    infighting in the ruling family.

                    In late 1953, the FCC adopted the RCA compatible system, commonly referred to as the NTSC system.
                    The first color television sets for this system were sold in 1954. They used a 15 inch screen. Later
                    that year, 19 inch sets were made, and by 1955 all sets were made with a 21 inch picture tube.

                    Mammals and birds are warm-blooded, which means that they can make their own body heat even when it
                    is cold outside. Whether it is sunny and hot outside or there is a snowstorm and it is very cold,
                    warm-blooded animals have body temperatures that usually stay the same.

                    What's unincorporated territory? Unincorporated territory is a legal term of art in United States
                    law denoting an area controlled by the government of
                    the U.S. "where fundamental rights apply as a matter of law, but other constitutional rights are not
                    available".
